## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js / Python 3
- Arduino IDE
- ESP32 drivers
- MongoDB / Firebase setup
- Cloud API keys (e.g., OpenWeather)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/autonomous-bee-health-ecosystem-management-system.git
cd autonomous-bee-health-ecosystem-management-system
npm install   # or pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Running the Project


```bash
npm run dev      # For frontend/backend server
python main.py   # For sensor processing / ML model
```

### 📈 Usage

- Deploy the ESP32 in the beehive with required sensors.
- Start data collection and stream it to the backend.
- Access the dashboard for visual analytics and insights.
- Receive alerts via app or SMS when anomalies are detected.





To run this Flask backend, follow these steps:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Navigate to the project directory (where run.py is located) in your terminal.
Create a virtual environment (if not already created) by running:
textpython -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
On MacOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate


Install the required dependencies by running:
textpip install -r requirements.txt

Set up the database (e.g., MySQL) and configure the connection in your app module (e.g., in config.py or similar).
Run the application by executing:
textpython run.py


The backend should now be running locally, accessible at http://localhost:5000 with debug mode enabled.
